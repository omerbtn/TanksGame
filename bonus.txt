BONUSES
=========

This file documents the additional features implemented as part of the bonus section in the tank game assignment.

1. Support for Multiple Players
----------------------------------
The system has been extended to support up to 9 players instead of just 2. This includes:

- Generalization of tank and player logic to work with any number of players.
- As part of the task requirements, we added support for multiple tanks for each player.
- Dynamic iteration over players and tanks using data structures like `std::map<int, std::pair<Player, std::vector<Tank>>>`.

This improves the scalability and flexibility of the game engine and allows for advanced multi-player strategies and simulations.

2. Printer Class Abstraction
-------------------------------
I introduced a `Printer` base class using CRTP (Curiously Recurring Template Pattern) to standardize the way boards are printed. This will allow easy extension in the future to various output modes:

- Text-based CLI output
- ANSI-colored CLI output
- Planned: VisualPrinter in the next step.

By separating the printing logic from the game logic, the code becomes easier to test, extend, and debug.

3. Human Player / User Interaction Algorithm
-----------------------------------------------
I implemented a custom `UserAlgorithm` that allows a user to control a tank interactively from the command line.

Features:
- Supports intuitive command inputs like `f`, `forward`, `shoot`, `left45`, etc.
- Includes an in-game help system (`help`) listing all available actions.
- Input is normalized and validated to prevent crashes or invalid commands.

This makes the game playable by a human, and demonstrates the flexibility of the algorithm interface.

----
Note:
Previous bonus features were also adjusted accordingly: although the static configuration system remained unchanged, it continued to facilitate flexible parameter management, 
and the existing Google Tests were updated to support interfaces and the required code changes.

Summary
-------
These additions enhance the flexibility, reliability, and maintainability of the project.  
The modular design approach provides scalable support for multiple players and visualization strategies, while the human interaction layer enables deeper testing and engagement.  
All features are implemented in a fully automatic and seamless manner and are ready for future extensions in upcoming assignments.
